# Pizza_Calculator

Fully functional pizza calculator for Android. 
Not perfectly optimized for varying screen sizes, so expect white space if device is long.
Ingredients provided are: oil, sugar, salt, yeast, and honey. Allows input of one more ingredient. 
To the best of my knowledge volume measurements are correct, but please measure by weight anyways. Volumes for salt and yeast assume table and instant, respectively.
